    <h1>🌇 Golden Hour</h1>
    <p><strong>Scientific Definition:</strong><br>
    Golden hour occurs when the sun is <strong>between 6° above and 6° below the horizon</strong>. During this time, sunlight travels through more of the Earth's atmosphere, scattering shorter blue wavelengths and allowing longer red and orange wavelengths to dominate.</p>

    <p><strong>Photographic Characteristics:</strong><br>
    - Warm, soft, golden light<br>
    - Long shadows and gentle contrast<br>
    - Ideal for portraits, landscapes, and cityscapes</p>

    <p><strong>Timeframe:</strong><br>
    Approximately <strong>1 hour after sunrise</strong> and <strong>1 hour before sunset</strong>, depending on your location and season.</p>
