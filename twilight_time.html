    <h1>🌠 Twilight Time</h1>
    <p><strong>Scientific Definition:</strong><br>
    Twilight is the time between sunset and darkness (or between darkness and sunrise). It is divided into three phases based on the sun’s angle below the horizon:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Civil Twilight</strong> (Sun 0° to -6°): Bright enough for most outdoor activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Nautical Twilight</strong> (Sun -6° to -12°): Horizon still visible at sea.</li>
        <li><strong>Astronomical Twilight</strong> (Sun -12° to -18°): Faint light, stars become visible.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Photographic Characteristics:</strong><br>
    - Varies from soft light to deep blue<br>
    - Ideal for astrophotography, silhouettes, and long exposures</p>
